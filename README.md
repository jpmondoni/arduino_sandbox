# arduino_sandbox
Some small projects with arduino.

## Repo purpose
My goal is to post some experiments, tutorial codes and small projects developed with Arduino.

## Repo structure
Every folder will represent a different project. Inside I will try to keep an updated dependency list, such as parts and libraries.
On new projects I will keep circuit schemes available.
