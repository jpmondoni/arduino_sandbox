## Project goal
The idea of the project was to develop a simple integration with temperature and humidity and post this data on Twitter at a given interval.

## Dependencies
* Arduino Ethernet Shield and Library
* [Arduino Twitter Library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/TwitterLibrary)
* Temperature & Humidity Sensor

## Ideas and applications
* A similar app could be used to gather data from a sensor and send to an API via a POST request, or directly to a database. For instance, one could develop a dashboard on a web front-end, based on data from the sensor.
